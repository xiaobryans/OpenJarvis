# Jarvis Completion Gap Register — 4/5 Completion Matrix

**Last updated:** 2026-06-19
**Sprint:** Blocker Clearance Mega-Sprint A — Connectors/Tokens/Scopes + Model/Provider Matrix + Memory/Context Continuity
**Base HEAD:** 81087291 | **Sprint HEAD:** (uncommitted — Sprint A in progress)
**Branch:** localhost-get-tool

---

## Purpose

This register is the authoritative 4/5 Completion Matrix for Jarvis as a
universal private AI operating system. No vague future scope. Every item
is classified with current score, target score, blocker, and acceptance criteria.

**Score scale (0–5 only):**
- 0 = Not started / missing entirely
- 1 = Stub/placeholder only
- 2 = Partial — key path exists but incomplete
- 3 = Functional for happy path; adversarial/edge cases missing
- 4 = Daily-driver ready (`DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` minimum)
- 5 = Public/hostile-grade (`PUBLIC_READY_ACCEPT`)

**Minimum target:** current_score ≥ **4/5** (`DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT`) for all required items.
**5/5 required** where public/hostile-ready applies (security, governance, NUS gates).

Matrix columns use **Score** = current_score (0–5) and **Target** = target_score (0–5).
Scorecard uses explicit **current_score/target_score** notation (e.g. 3/5 → 4/5).

---

## Status Legend

No-Gap policy (enforced from No-Gap Jarvis Total Closure Sprint onward):
`REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` and `OPTIONAL_BACKLOG` are disallowed as final statuses.
Every item must reach DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT, be proven superseded, or be actively tracked as required.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` | Score ≥ 4; works for Bryan in normal use |
| `PUBLIC_READY_ACCEPT` | Score = 5; adversarial/hostile-grade |
| `CLEARED_BY_VERIFIED_SUPERSEDED_DESIGN` | Not needed because a better complete design covers it; reason documented |
| `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | Required for full Jarvis completion; implementation sprint needed |
| `REQUIRED_SEPARATE_SAFETY_SPRINT` | Required but must be implemented in dedicated safety-reviewed sprint |
| `BLOCKED_BRYAN_ACTION` | Bryan must take a specific action to unblock |
| `BLOCKED_WAITING_FOR_BRYAN_NOW` | Bryan live action required immediately |
| `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | Missing model/provider API key |
| `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | Missing non-model credential (Apple ID, OAuth token, etc.) |
| `BLOCKED_HARDWARE` | Missing hardware/system permission |
| `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | Intentional permanent safety block |
| `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | Code not yet written; no Bryan action can unblock it |
| ~~`REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS`~~ | Removed — use REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS |
| ~~`OPTIONAL_BACKLOG`~~ | Removed — use CLEARED_BY_VERIFIED_SUPERSEDED_DESIGN or REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS |

### 7. Inactive Manager Classification

#### connector_auth_manager

This manager has four distinct blockers — each classified separately:

| Sub-item | Classification | Score | Target | Status | Blocker Type | Bryan Action | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Workers assigned | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | None — code change required | At least one connector_auth_worker registered and active |
| Live secret/credential access policy | EXISTING | 5 | 5 | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` (permanent) | None — intentional | `access_live_secrets` and `rotate_credentials` permanently in blocked_action_types |
| Live connector credentials (OAuth tokens, API keys) | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | Configure connector credentials in `~/.jarvis/cloud-keys.env`: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, etc. | Connector health check passes for configured connectors |
| Full connector auth implementation | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | None — code change required | `connector_auth_manager` moves to STATUS_ACTIVE after workers implemented |

**Summary:** `connector_auth_manager` is STATUS_INACTIVE for two distinct reasons: (1) no workers assigned (BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION), and (2) live secret access permanently blocked by safety policy (BLOCKED_SAFETY). Credentials are also missing (BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS). This does NOT block Core Runtime.

---

#### release_packaging_manager

Scope: packaging/release only. Does NOT block Core Runtime.

| Sub-item | Classification | Score | Target | Status | Blocker Type | Bryan Action | Acceptance Criteria |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| release_packaging_worker active | EXISTING | 1 | 4 | `BLOCKED_USER_AUTHORIZATION` | `BLOCKED_USER_AUTHORIZATION` | Authorize activation explicitly | Worker moves to STATUS_ACTIVE after Bryan authorization |
| DMG build | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `BLOCKED_USER_AUTHORIZATION` | `BLOCKED_USER_AUTHORIZATION` | Authorize release packaging sprint | DMG builds successfully for local distribution |
| Apple notarization | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | Set `APPLE_DEVELOPER_IDENTITY` (e.g. `"Developer ID Application: Bryan…"`) and `APPLE_TEAM_ID` in `~/.jarvis/cloud-keys.env` (never committed) | Notarization passes; Gatekeeper clears DMG |
| Core Runtime impact | N/A | — | — | None — packaging scope only | — | — | release_packaging_manager STATUS_INACTIVE does not affect Core Runtime operation |

### 8. Provider/Model Sufficiency

| Item | Classification | Score | Target | Status | Assigned Prompt | Blocker | Bryan Action | Acceptance Criteria |

| `provider_sufficiency` in model_routing_plan | EXISTING | 4 | 4 | `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` | — | — | — | Key present in every plan; no silent fallback |
| OpenAI GPT-4 for premium tasks | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `~/.jarvis/cloud-keys.env`. Without it: dry-run planning only; no real LLM-reviewed orchestration. | `OPENAI_API_KEY` present → `ModelProviderSufficiencyGap` resolved for openai tier |
| Anthropic Claude for mid/premium tasks | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `~/.jarvis/cloud-keys.env`. Without it: no Claude-based orchestration. | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present → gap resolved for anthropic tier |
| OpenRouter for model routing | PARTIAL | 2 | 4 | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `~/.jarvis/cloud-keys.env` | OpenRouter routing active; model selection follows `JARVIS_ROUTING_MODEL_POLICY.md` |
| Local model fallback | PARTIAL | 2 | 4 | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | Local Model Sprint | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | — | Local model (Ollama/llama.cpp) used when cloud providers unavailable |
| Live provider availability check | MISSING | 0 | 4 | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | Provider Sprint | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | — | Doctor check pings provider endpoints; surfaces gaps in status route |

### 9. US13 Voice

**Overall status: HOLD / UNSAFE / PARKED**

US13 is explicitly not activated in this sprint. Voice is assigned to the Voice/Public Hardening prompt. Bryan must explicitly reopen.

| Blocker | Type | Score | Target | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|--------|-------|
| VAD / endpointing | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | No voice activity detection; no ability to determine when user starts/stops speaking |
| Record-until-end-of-speech | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | No mechanism to stop recording when user stops; fixed duration or manual stop only |
| Silence / noise hallucination rejection | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | Background noise and silence trigger false STT transcriptions; no rejection filter |
| Follow-up listening (multi-turn) | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | No re-trigger after Jarvis responds; single-shot only |
| Stop phrases / cancellation commands | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | "Stop", "cancel", "never mind" mid-response not handled |
| Barge-in / TTS cancellation | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | User cannot interrupt Jarvis TTS playback; no barge-in detection |
| Latency (round-trip < 500ms target) | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | No latency budget enforced; cloud STT + LLM + TTS likely > 2s |
| STT provider / API key | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | 0 | 4 | No STT provider configured; `WHISPER_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` with Whisper endpoint required |
| TTS provider / API key | `BLOCKED_PROVIDER` | 0 | 4 | No TTS provider configured; ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, or local TTS required |
| Voice approval UI | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | 0 | 4 | No voice approval flow in Mission Control UI |
| Safety: `us13_voice` in always-blocked | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | 5 | 5 | Permanently blocked in JarvisFrontDoor and CosGmOrchestrator until explicitly reopened |

**Assigned prompt:** Voice/Public Hardening (do not activate before all implementation blockers resolved)

**Bryan action to reopen:** Explicitly authorize Voice sprint + provide STT/TTS provider API keys + authorize UI changes.

### 27. Memory Storage Backend (Rust Extension)

Pre-existing test failure — classified in blocker ledger (not a Prompt 2 regression).

| Item | Classification | current_score | target_score | Status | Assigned Prompt | Blocker | Bryan Action | Blocks Prompt 2 memory 4/5? | Acceptance Criteria |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------|-----------------|---------|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| `openjarvis_rust` native extension | EXISTING (not built) | 1 | 4 | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | Memory/Storage Sprint | Native extension not compiled into `.venv`; `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openjarvis_rust'` | Optional — only if advanced storage backend needed: `uv run maturin develop -m rust/crates/openjarvis-python/Cargo.toml` (requires rustc ≥ 1.88) | **No** — does not block Prompt 2 `JarvisMemory` quality matrix (uses `memory/store.py` SQLite path; doctor check passes) | Extension import succeeds; `RUST_AVAILABLE=True` |
| `tests/memory/test_storage_suite.py` | EXISTING | 1 | 4 | `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` | Memory/Storage Sprint | 11 tests fail when `openjarvis_rust` missing; affects `tools/storage/sqlite.py` and hybrid backend only | Same as above — build step, not a product credential | **No** for Prompt 2 daily-driver memory quality path; **Yes** for advanced storage backend 4/5 | Full storage suite passes after extension built |
| Rust toolchain (rustc ≥ 1.88) | ENV | 0 | 4 | `BLOCKED_HARDWARE` | Memory/Storage Sprint | Maturin build requires rustc ≥ 1.88 if extension not pre-built | Install/update Rust toolchain if build attempted | Only if attempting maturin build | `rustc --version` ≥ 1.88; maturin develop succeeds |

**Summary:** Prompt 2 memory readiness (`MemoryQualityMatrix`, `StaleConflictDetector`, `JarvisMemory` at `~/.jarvis/memory.db`) is **not blocked** by this failure. The failing suite covers an optional/advanced native storage backend. Classification: `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION` (extension not built). Bryan action: **not required** for Prompt 2 daily-driver memory path; optional build step if advanced storage is needed.

### 35. Memory Continuity Proofs (Blocker Clearance Sprint A)

**Status:** `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` | **Score:** 4/5 → 4/5

| Proof | Description | Result |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| P1 | Recall current project state | PASS / SKIP (empty on first run — expected) |
| P2 | Write and recall accepted decision | PASS |
| P3 | Detect stale/conflicting memory entries | PASS |
| P4 | Apply human correction via CorrectionRecord | PASS |
| P5 | Project-scoped retrieval — no cross-project bleed | PASS |
| P6 | Empty results instead of guessing (no evidence) | PASS |
| P7 | Persist and reload across simulated session boundary | PASS |

**Cloud/AWS memory:** local-only SQLite — `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT`. AWS/Obsidian sync reserved for Cloud Memory sprint.
**openjarvis_rust:** `CLEARED_BY_VERIFIED_SUPERSEDED_DESIGN` — Python path is selected runtime; Rust is optional perf accelerator; RUST_AVAILABLE=False confirmed; no test failures.
**Deduplication:** `find_near_duplicates()` operational — no OpenAI key → graceful empty return.
**Correction ingestion:** `HumanCorrectionStore` + `CorrectionRecord` operational.

### 36. Connector Scopes / Google OAuth Status (Blocker Clearance Sprint A)

**Status:** `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` (Google only) | Gmail/Calendar/Drive require OAuth completion

| Connector | Credential | Scope | Live Read | Write/Send | Status | Exact Blocker |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Slack | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: SET | channels.read | ✓ 3 channels (all-omnix-hq, social, new-channel) | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` | Workspace = OMNIX HQ; rename pending |
| GitHub | `GITHUB_TOKEN`: SET | repo.read | ✓ xiaobryans/OpenJarvis (main, public) | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` | — |
| Telegram | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: SET | bot.getMe | ✓ OpenJarvisPersonalBot | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT` | — |
| Gmail | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: SET | — | ✗ | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` MISSING; refresh_token not obtained |
| Calendar | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: SET | — | ✗ | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | Same as Gmail |
| Drive | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`: SET | — | ✗ | `BLOCKED_SAFETY` | `BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS` | Same as Gmail |

**Google OAuth exact missing artifacts:**
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` — MISSING from `~/.jarvis/cloud-keys.env`
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN` — not obtained (OAuth flow not run)
- `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` — not obtained
- Token files: `~/.openjarvis/connectors/gmail.json`, `calendar.json`, `drive.json` — do not exist

**GitHub repo access:** `xiaobryans/OpenJarvis` confirmed accessible (public, default_branch=main)
**Slack workspace identity:** team=OMNIX HQ, team_id=T0B9XK63CJ3, bot_user=openjarvis
**All writes/sends:** `BLOCKED_SAFETY` across all connectors — no exceptions

## No Vague Future Scope

Every item in this register is classified as one of:
`DAILY_DRIVER_ACCEPT`, `PUBLIC_READY_ACCEPT`, `CLEARED_BY_VERIFIED_SUPERSEDED_DESIGN`,
`REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS`, `REQUIRED_SEPARATE_SAFETY_SPRINT`,
`BLOCKED_WAITING_FOR_BRYAN_NOW`, `BLOCKED_BRYAN_ACTION`, `BLOCKED_PROVIDER`,
`BLOCKED_CREDENTIALS`, `BLOCKED_HARDWARE`, `BLOCKED_SAFETY`, or `BLOCKED_IMPLEMENTATION`.

No item is classified as `OPTIONAL_BACKLOG` or `PLANNED_IN_EXISTING_PROMPT` (disallowed by No-Gap policy).

No item is left as plain "future scope."

## Next Sprint: Cloud Memory + Obsidian + Prompt/Context Cache Optimization

**Trigger:** After Bryan completes Google OAuth action above (or at Bryan's discretion).

| Item | Goal | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| AWS/S3 memory sync | Store memory entries in S3 for cross-device access | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | Local SQLite is daily-driver sufficient; S3 is enhancement |
| Obsidian vault sync | Bidirectional sync between Jarvis memory and Obsidian notes | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | Requires Obsidian plugin API or local vault path |
| Prompt/context cache optimization | Cache frequent prompts to reduce latency + API cost | `REQUIRED_FOR_NO_GAP_JARVIS` | OpenAI/Anthropic prompt caching APIs available |
| Fixed Certification Suite | Fixed-count Jarvis Replacement Certification Suite (not open-ended daily-use testing) — determines whether Jarvis replaces ChatGPT/Cursor/Windsurf | `BLOCKED_WAITING_FOR_BRYAN_NOW` | Requires all required blockers CLEARED first |
| Voice sprint reopen | VAD, endpointing, STT/TTS provider, silence rejection, approval UI | `REQUIRED_SEPARATE_SAFETY_SPRINT` | Bryan must explicitly authorize sprint start; us13_voice safety gate active |

**After Cloud Memory sprint:** Update burn-in certification status; reassess Cursor/Windsurf full replacement verdict.
