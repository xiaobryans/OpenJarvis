# Orchestrator Stack — Status & Option-A Implementation Guide

**Status:** PARKED (decision: Option B, 2026-06-26). Not on the live chat path.
**Next major sprint:** Option A — wire the full hierarchy into live chat. This
document is the spec to execute that sprint. It is a TODO/implementation guide,
not a "parked indefinitely" notice.

---

## 1. Current reality (verified)

The live chat path (`POST /v1/chat/completions` → `server/routes.py` →
`_handle_stream_agent` → `app.state.agent`, an `OrchestratorAgent`) does **not**
touch any of the modules below. They are real, substantial code that no real
user request currently reaches.

| Module | Lines | Reachable today via | Entanglement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orchestrator/cos_gm.py` (`CosGmOrchestrator`) | ~530 | `/v1/orchestrator/*` (dry-run), `/v1/frontdoor/submit` (classify-only), `doctor/checks.py`, tests | ~19 importers (plan9, frontdoor, manager_registry, nus, …) |
| `orchestrator/activation.py` | ~838 | cos_gm + orchestrator routes | medium |
| `agents/hybrid/` (conductor, toolorchestra, archon, minions, …) | ~12,261 | imported only by `agents/__init__.py` (registration) + `tools/storage/__init__.py` | low (registration-only) |
| `agents/hybrid/skillorchestra/` | ~3,126 | `evals/scorers/swebench_harness.py` + hybrid internals | used by **evals** (do not remove without fixing evals) |

**Why parked, not removed:** cos_gm has ~19 importers (removal cascades and
would break doctor checks); skillorchestra is load-bearing for the SWE-bench
eval. Removal is high-risk for low benefit. Parking loses nothing and keeps the
~16.7k lines available for Option A.

## 2. Target architecture (Bryan's vision)

```
Bryan → Jarvis PA → COS/GM → Domain Managers → Workers → Testers → COS/GM → Jarvis PA → Bryan
```

- **Jarvis PA** — the single user-facing front door (identity, persona, the
  voice Bryan talks to). Owns the conversation and the final reply.
- **COS/GM** (Chief of Staff / General Manager) — `CosGmOrchestrator`. Receives
  the task from Jarvis PA, plans it (`activation.py` domain→manager mapping),
  dispatches to managers, runs the verifier gate, returns a synthesized result.
- **Domain Managers** — own a domain (e.g. coding, comms, research, finance,
  ops). Decompose the task and assign workers. (~17 today — audit in §5.)
- **Workers** — do the actual unit of work. Prefer **many small-scope workers**
  over few large ones.
- **Testers** — verify worker output before it flows back up (the existing
  `VerifierGate` is the seed of this).

### Tiered routing (latency-aware) — the core behavior to implement

| Tier | Budget | Path |
|---|---|---|
| **Instant** | < 3 s | Jarvis PA answers directly. No hierarchy. (e.g. time, simple recall, chit-chat.) |
| **Fast** | < 15 s | Jarvis PA → COS/GM → **one** manager → worker(s) → back. |
| **Standard** | 15 s – 2 min | Full hierarchy, sequential. |
| **Complex** | 2 min+ | Full hierarchy, **parallel workers**, with **live status updates** to Bryan. |

A classifier (cheap, local-first — reuse the `complexity` scorer already in
`routes.py`) picks the tier per turn. Default to the cheapest tier that fits.

### Live status updates (for Standard/Complex)

- Stream what Jarvis is doing in real time over the existing SSE channel — never
  leave Bryan in silence.
- Give an **up-front time estimate** for complex tasks.
- **Update the estimate** as work progresses.
- Report **actual completion time** when done.
- Surface per-stage progress ("manager X dispatched 3 workers", "tester passed
  2/3", …) as SSE `status`/`progress` events the UI can render.

## 3. Where the wiring connects (concrete entry points)

1. **`server/routes.py`** — the live chat dispatch. Today: `_handle_stream_agent`
   runs a single `OrchestratorAgent`. Option A: add a tier classifier; for
   Fast/Standard/Complex, route through `JarvisFrontDoor.handle()` /
   `CosGmOrchestrator` instead, streaming status events back. Keep Instant on
   the current direct path. Preserve the safe fallback to the current agent on
   any orchestration error (do not regress chat).
2. **`frontdoor/frontdoor.py`** — `JarvisFrontDoor.handle()` already chains to
   `CosGmOrchestrator`. This is the intended bridge; today it's only called by
   doctor + tests.
3. **`server/frontdoor_routes.py`** — `/v1/frontdoor/submit` is **classify-only**
   today (returns a routing summary, never executes). Option A: make it actually
   invoke the orchestrator, or fold its classification into the chat path.
4. **`orchestrator/worker_adapters.py`** — several adapters return **dry-run
   stubs** (`_execute_safe` returns a planning dict). Option A: replace stubs
   with real execution behind the NUS gate (now correctly fail-closed).
5. **`orchestrator/cos_gm.py`** — real plan→dispatch→verify loop. Trace events
   now log (P3.2). Wire its output into SSE status updates.

## 4. Option-A implementation checklist (execute in this order)

- [ ] Tier classifier in the chat path (reuse complexity scorer; map to 4 tiers).
- [ ] Instant tier: keep current direct `OrchestratorAgent` path unchanged.
- [ ] Bridge: route Fast/Standard/Complex through `JarvisFrontDoor` →
      `CosGmOrchestrator`, with fallback-to-direct on error.
- [ ] Replace dry-run worker stubs (`worker_adapters.py`) with real execution.
- [ ] SSE status/progress event protocol + frontend rendering.
- [ ] Time-estimate up-front + live re-estimate + actual completion time.
- [ ] Parallel worker execution for Complex tier.
- [ ] Managers/workers audit (§5) applied.
- [ ] End-to-end verification per tier (latency + correctness + no silent fail).
- [ ] Regression: Instant-tier latency must not exceed today's chat latency.

## 5. Managers & Workers audit (do as part of Option A)

There are ~17 managers today. Before wiring, audit the full set:
- Read every manager and worker definition (registries:
  `orchestrator/manager_registry.py`, worker registry, `agents/roster.py`).
- **Remove** redundant/overlapping ones — record which and why.
- **Add** missing ones to make the set comprehensive and universal.
- Prefer **many small-scope workers** over few large-scope workers.
- Caution: managers/workers are imported by doctor/orchestrator-routes/evals —
  validate those still pass after any removal (this is why the destructive audit
  belongs to the Option-A sprint, not the parking step).

---

## 6. Parking guarantees

- No behavior change from parking. All four modules remain importable and their
  existing dry-run/doctor/eval surfaces keep working.
- `cos_gm.py` carries a header pointer to this document so anyone reading it
  knows it is parked-pending-Option-A and where the spec lives.
